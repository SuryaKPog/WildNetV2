# WildNetV2 - Classifying Wildlife with MobileNetV2

# 📌 Project Description

WildNetV2 is a deep learning-based animal classification model built using MobileNetV2, optimized for speed and accuracy.
This project aims to classify various animal species using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), making it a powerful tool for wildlife identification and conservation efforts.

# 🚀 Key Features:

✔️ Fast & Efficient – Uses MobileNetV2, a lightweight model optimized for real-time classification.

✔️ High Accuracy – Achieves over 90% classification accuracy on a diverse dataset of animals.

✔️ Optimized for Edge Devices – Can be deployed on mobile phones, embedded systems, and cloud platforms.

✔️ Supports 90+ Animal Classes – Recognizes a wide range of species from different habitats.

✔️ Transfer Learning & Fine-Tuning – Enhances accuracy by leveraging pre-trained weights.

# 🔬 How It Works:

Preprocessing – Images are resized to 240×240, normalized, and augmented for better generalization.

Model Training – MobileNetV2 is fine-tuned on an extensive animal dataset to improve classification accuracy.

Prediction & Evaluation – The trained model predicts the species from an image and is evaluated on a test dataset.

Deployment Ready – The model can be easily integrated into a web app, mobile app, or an API for real-world use.
